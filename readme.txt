== Description ==

Free Coupons! Discounts! Free Vouchers!

Online shoppers do love to see these terms while swarming over e-commerce websites. Well, it’s no secret that WooCommerce provides an in-built coupon feature. But it may not seem enough if you are trying to draw your customers in significant numbers. Instead, a solely dedicated coupon plugin would serve the purpose more efficiently.

Therefore, <strong>Ultimate Coupons For WooCommerce</strong> is a WordPress coupon plugin you can place your bet on. It combines more powerful features and applications to the default WooCommerce Coupon. Likewise, buy x get x deals, create cart rules, restrictions, share coupon system, scheduling, and many other powerful customizations.

**Main FEATURES**

Fortunately, this WordPress coupon plugin is available in a free version. It comes with a handsome number of features that would dazzle you for sure. Let’s have a quick glimpse at them.

###⋄ Buy X Get X Deals###

There is barely any alternative to the BOGO (Buy-One-Get-One) coupons when it comes to offering lucrative deals for customers. Besides, when it comes to gaining a handsome profit margin, BOGO deals are much more convenient compared to other services. 

For example, if you’d offer a 30% off deal on a product that might take $100 to purchase, then by subtracting the cost price of 30$ you’d gain a profit of 40$ only ($70 discount price minus a cost cut of 30$). On the contrary, on a Woocommerce BOGO deal (Buy 2 get 1 free) if you sell 3 products costing $100 each, you can make a profit of $110 right away.

<strong>HOW???</strong>

Suppose, you are selling jeans on your e-commerce site. Offering a “Buy 2 get 1 free” deal would actually cost $300 for 3 pairs of those jeans. Now cut the cost price ($30) on each of them and $100 on the free jeans as well. 

<strong>So, what do you get?</strong>
<strong>A whooping profit of $110 right there!</strong>

This smart coupons plugin would allow you to manually set a Buy X Get X offer regardless of product categories. You can also make the deal available for repetitive use of the coupon.

In addition to that, by using this plugin you would receive 3 types of BOGO discounts that include overriding product price (can even make it free), percentage & fixed discount (can deduct a fixed amount from the product price). Besides, you can trigger the deal when all/any (Match All/ Match Any) target products’ quantity would match with the specified amount.

###⋄ Cart Conditions###

The idea of cart conditions emerges when you need to apply certain restrictions to prevent the misuse of the WooCommerce coupons on your site. This advanced coupon plugin would offer you a very user-friendly feature so that you can comfortably set the coupon rules. 

Additionally, you can impose them based on product category, first purchase, subtotal amount, cart quantity, and many more. Choosing between AND/OR logic, you’d also be able to include multiple groups of conditions. That said, there are a dozen more options available that are waiting for you to play with.

###⋄ Restrictions###

Only when a set of conditions is matched, you can easily create restrictions via this plugin. In this feature, you can allow/disallow or specify user roles. The service covers a wide range, from a customer to an administrator regarding the application of coupons. Also, limiting or offering multiple payment and shipping methods are available as well.

###⋄ Scheduling###

This particular feature deals with scheduling a coupon’s span of validity. That means you can set both the starting and expiring dates (mentioning time) for a coupon to be available for the customers.

###⋄ Share Coupon Via URL###

Suppose you want any of your potential customers directly to land on your site & without having any hassle of using coupon codes, they’d be able to purchase products. To help you with executing the idea, this will be the perfect feature. 

You can share the URL (having coupon code) with your potential customers. Not only that, you can even customize the URL structure & coupon code too.

###⋄ Maximum Discount###

Offering discounts have always been a popular business strategy to lure customers into purchasing several products at once. Using this plugin, you can fix the maximum discount rate up to any amount. Eventually, such offerings would seem beneficial to you, more like shooting at two birds with one arrow. 

A maximum discount offer will draw your customer’s attention accordingly and provoke them to purchase from your site. At the same time, you can also restrict them from scooping back a chunk of the spent amount.

###⋄ Global Settings: Banners and Popup Templates###
The first feature that you will come across in the global setting is customizing banners and templates. This plugin will allow you to create and display banners/templates to the visiting customers of your site.

It’d enable you to restrict user roles and set the display type as Popup/Header/Footer. After setting the title, description, and selecting a photo, you can resize them and customize the background and border colors as per your need.
